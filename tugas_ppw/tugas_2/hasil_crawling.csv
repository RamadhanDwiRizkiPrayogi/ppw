This paper explores the prevalence of power-law distributions in large-scale graph structures and their implications for graph query analysis. We investigate techniques for efficiently mining graphs that exhibit power-law characteristics, leveraging these distributions to optimize query performance and scalability. Our study presents a comprehensive review of existing methodologies for detecting power-law behavior in graphs, highlighting their impact on graph traversal, indexing, and query execution. We also examine algorithmic optimizations tailored for power-law graphs, including degree-based indexing, community-aware search techniques, and efficient subgraph matching approaches. Furthermore, we discuss the applications of power-law principles in diverse domains such as social network analysis, bioinformatics, and knowledge graphs. Through empirical analysis on real-world datasets, we demonstrate how power-law-aware techniques improve query efficiency and reduce computational complexity in large graph databases. The findings of this study offer valuable insights into the interplay between graph topology and query optimization, paving the way for enhanced graph mining frameworks. Our work contributes to the development of more scalable and intelligent graph query processing systems, with broad implications for data-driven decision-making."

Each constituent system has its own purpose and could operate and collaborate voluntarily with other constituent systems to achieve a common goal that cannot be treated by any of them in isolation. Objective: A constituent system may be deployed or undeployed at run-time within an SoS. Emergent behaviors may be undesirable and affect the behaviors of each constituent system and lead to unexpected operations and a lack of permanent status in the SoS. Thus, we need to continuously extract and represent the actual behaviors within the SoS at run-time. Method: In this paper, we implement the first step our “Architecture Mining” approach. Thus, we monitor an SoS and develop Discovery algorithm to extract the actual behaviors. The actual behaviors are presented by a “Discovered Model” dynamically and automatically built from the execution traces. Results: To implement our approach, we applied it to a case study entitled Smart City, which is an SoS including six types of constituent systems. We extracted the actual behaviors executed at run time from the SoS execution traces, which have never been modeled in any constituent system nor expected by the designer."

These methods allow you to train the system based on historical data and identify hidden patterns that may not be obvious in traditional analysis. Machine learning algorithms can be used to predict breakdowns, optimize production processes and identify anomalies in the operation of machinery. For example, with the help of training on data on the operation of equipment, you can create a model that will predict the probability of failure of a certain part under specified operating conditions."

Debates on ‘technological determinism Technological determinism ’ are considered here. As events, 9/11 and the 2000 dot-com crash are pegged as turning points. A broad argument is proposed about the condition of the Internet Polity thereafter. It is suggested that it became contained in two moves during the 2000s. This containment involved, first, a space of the internet opening beyond the scope of the Internet Polity. This space incorporated data exchanges between ‘smart’ objects, unsupervised systems, and machine-learning systems. Second, much of the Internet Polity discourse and collective life became concentrated in very large platforms, which have global reach, local penetration, and data-management standards. This move facilitated the burgeoning data market and fed into the first move. The two moves are outlined by focusing on two catchwords and related terms. The first is addressed via the connotations of ‘Internet of Things’ and ‘smart’ objects, and the second by pausing on ‘social networking’ (on ‘sites’ or ‘platforms’). This chapter, and the study, concludes by briefly reconsidering the formative first principles of the Internet Polity, and pinpointing areas for further investigations."
data mining,10.1007/978-3-031-93530-5_1,Introduction,"Many leading enterprises have started seeking opportunities to leverage advanced analytics on employee-related data to provide evidence-based insights into their workforce [65]. Among others, Google’s project “Oxygen” is an example of successfully deploying workforce analytics, which helped improve the company’s productivity and employee well-being and build up effective human resource management practices [40]. Yet, there are practical challenges that prevent workforce analytics from realizing its promise. One notable challenge is concerned with the absence of group-oriented analysis pivotal to strategy execution and organizational effectiveness [56]. For example, current workforce analytics has not yet enabled consistent comparisons across internal groups within organizations [44]."

Fairness in responsible process mining involves preventing unfair outcomes and recognizing potential biases that may arise in the different stages of process mining initiative. Acting fairly entails treating individuals equitably, irrespective of inherent or acquired characteristics such as gender, race, or disability, while ensuring compliance with legal and organizational fairness standards. While fairness in process mining has been explored in prior research, there remains a lack of conceptualization to identify, understand, and address fairness issues. To bridge this gap, we propose FairPM , a taxonomy that conceptualizes biases in process mining and the corresponding interventions to mitigate them. Our approach builds on theory adaptation as research method. It integrates an adaptation of biases and interventions from prior machine learning research into process mining. We illustrate the applicability of FairPM through three scenarios, demonstrating its relevance for both academia and industry. This research contributes to the growing field of fair process mining by providing a structured conceptualization that enables researchers and practitioners to diagnose biases and implement fairness interventions, ensuring equitable and unbiased process mining outcomes."

This paper presents efficient algorithms for FSM in complex networks, addressing the computational challenges posed by large-scale graph data. Traditional approaches often suffer from scalability issues due to the combinatorial explosion of subgraph candidates. To mitigate these challenges, we propose an optimized FSM framework leveraging advanced pruning techniques, graph compression, and parallel computing. Our approach incorporates pattern-growth strategies with heuristic search methods to improve computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy. We evaluate our proposed algorithms on benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant performance gains over existing methods in terms of runtime and memory consumption. Additionally, we explore real-world applications, such as detecting anomalous patterns in cybersecurity networks, identifying molecular structures in drug discovery, and analyzing connectivity patterns in social networks. The results underscore the potential of efficient FSM algorithms in extracting meaningful insights from complex graph data. This research contributes to the advancement of graph mining techniques, providing a scalable and effective solution for large-scale network analysis. Future work will explore deep learning-based enhancements to further optimize FSM in dynamic and evolving graph structures."

Machine learning models, including Linear Regression (LR), Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), and Huber Regressor (HR), were employed to develop a predictive framework for PF optimization. Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as R^2 (0.9829 for LR, 0.9827 for RANSAC, and 0.9824 for HR), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), demonstrating their high predictive accuracy. The findings highlight the capability of machine learning to improve blasting control, reduce environmental impacts, and promote sustainable mining practices. By integrating artificial intelligence into mining operations, this study advances the concept of intelligent mining, offering innovative solutions that enhance operational efficiency while fostering environmental stewardship."
